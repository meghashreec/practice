// What is a Module?
// A module is a file that contains related code (functions, variables, classes) and exports it to be reused elsewhere. It helps organize code logically and keeps things clean, maintainable, and reusable.
// ðŸ§  Think of a module as:
// A self-contained unit of code that can be imported and used in other files.
// ðŸŽ¯ What is Modularity
// Modularity is the principle of breaking a large program into smaller, independent, and interchangeable pieces (modules). Each module does one thing well.
