// ðŸ”¸ Imperative Programming
// Focuses on how to achieve a result
// You give step-by-step instructions
// You manage control flow with conditionals, loops, variables, etc.

// ðŸ”¸ Declarative Programming
// Focuses on what you want to achieve
// More concise, expressive, and readable
// Leverages built-in functions, expressions, or abstractions

//check that if the square of that number is even or not

//imperative way

const asqure = a * a;
